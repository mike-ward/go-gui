# svg_css_states

Demonstrates CSS `:hover` and `:focus` pseudo-class matching driven
by `HoveredElementID` / `FocusedElementID` on `SvgCfg`.

The embedded `<style>` block defines hover/focus rules for two
element ids (`#ring`, `#dot`). Buttons toggle the IDs that the SVG
view forwards through `SvgCfg`; the cascade re-runs and the widget
re-renders with the new colors applied.

**Status:** v0.15.0 ships the parser/cascade/cache plumbing. The
widget does not yet auto-detect mouse hover — apps drive the IDs
themselves. Pointer-tracking hover for the `Svg` widget is the v0.16
followup.

To wire it manually: hit-test the cached SVG paths via
`TessellatedPath.ContainsPoint(px, py)` (added in v0.13.0), recover
the corresponding element id, and feed it back through `SvgCfg` on
the next View pass.

Run:

```
go run ./examples/svg_css_states/
