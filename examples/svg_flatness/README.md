# svg_flatness

Demonstrates `SvgCfg.FlatnessTolerance` — the tessellation tolerance
floor in viewBox units.

A curve-heavy SVG is rendered five times with increasing tolerance:
default (0), 0.5, 1.5, 4, 10. Higher values produce coarser
polylines and fewer triangles, visible as faceting on the Bezier
edges. Use this knob to trade visual fidelity for vertex count on
icon walls or large path-heavy renders.

Default `FlatnessTolerance=0` keeps the renderer's built-in 0.15
floor — fingerprint-stable with prior versions.

Run:

```
go run ./examples/svg_flatness/
```
