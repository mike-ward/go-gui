# svg_css_vars

Demonstrates v0.14.0 custom-property additions:

- **`var(--name, fallback)`** — fallback honored when the named
  variable is undefined. The inner rect's `fill` resolves to the
  fallback `#f1f5f9` because `--missing` is never defined.
- **`calc()`** — `calc(var(--base) + 1px)` computes the stroke
  width. The base value is mixed with a unit-bearing literal and
  resolves at parse time.
- **Theme switching** — rebuilds the SVG source with a different
  `--primary` / `--accent` per theme; the cascade picks the new
  values transparently.
