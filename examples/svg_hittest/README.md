# svg_hittest

Click any shape in the rendered SVG; the right pane prints the
matched `PathID` and viewBox coordinates. Demonstrates
`TessellatedPath.ContainsPoint` with the typical "display→viewBox"
coord conversion (divide by `cached.Scale`, add viewBox origin).

## Run

```
go run ./examples/svg_hittest
```

Click in the empty space between shapes to see the empty-cell
readout; click on a circle/rect/triangle to see its PathID. Note
that `ContainsPoint` ignores stroke paths — fill triangulation is
the hit target.
