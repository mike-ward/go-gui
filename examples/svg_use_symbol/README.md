# svg_use_symbol

Demonstrates SVG `<use href="#id">` and `<symbol>` resolution.

A `<symbol id="star">` block is defined once in `<defs>`; four
`<use>` references render the symbol at different positions, each
with a per-instance `fill` override. The result is rendered side by
side with a manually duplicated equivalent so any geometric or
color delta is immediately visible.

A second sample shows `<use>` referencing a single `<circle>`
element, including per-instance `transform="scale(...)"` and
`transform="rotate(...)"` overrides on the use sites.

Run:

```
go run ./examples/svg_use_symbol/
```
