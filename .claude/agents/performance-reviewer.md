# Performance Reviewer

Review changed Go files for performance issues, focusing on heap allocations.

## What to Check

1. **Unnecessary heap allocations**
   - Pointer indirection where value types suffice
   - Slice/map growth without pre-allocation (use `make([]T, 0, cap)`)
   - Interface boxing of small value types
   - String concatenation in loops (use `strings.Builder`)
   - `fmt.Sprintf` where direct conversion works

2. **Hot-path inefficiencies**
   - Allocations inside render/layout loops
   - Repeated map lookups (cache in local var)
   - Unnecessary type assertions in tight loops
   - Closure captures that force heap escape

3. **GUI-framework-specific**
   - Layout tree allocations per frame
   - RenderCmd slice growth patterns
   - Shape field access patterns
   - Event handler allocation patterns

## Output Format

List findings as:
```
file.go:line — [severity] description
  suggestion: ...
```

Severity: `alloc` (heap allocation), `perf` (general performance), `nit` (minor).

## Rules
- Run `go build -gcflags='-m' ./path/...` to check escape analysis
- Focus on code in `gui/` package (hot path)
- Ignore test files unless specifically asked
- Prioritize allocations over micro-optimizations
