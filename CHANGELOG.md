# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `<use>` referencing `<symbol viewBox=...>` now honors
  `preserveAspectRatio`. Default is `xMidYMid meet` (uniform scale +
  center) per SVG 1.1; `preserveAspectRatio="none"` opts back into
  legacy independent-axis stretch; `slice` uses uniform max-scale
  (clip-to-use-box still TODO). Earlier impl always stretched.
- Distinct elements sharing one `filter="url(#X)"` now composite as
  separate offscreen groups in document order. Previously they were
  merged by FilterID and z-ordered against unfiltered siblings
  incorrectly. Each occurrence carries a per-element `FilterGroupKey`
  (parser counter assigned during cascade).
- Nested `<svg>` elements now establish a child viewport. `x`, `y`,
  `width`, `height` accept user-space units or percentages of the
  parent viewport; an inner `viewBox` (with `preserveAspectRatio`
  meet/slice/none) composes onto the cascaded transform from the
  element's own `transform=` attr. Descendants inherit paint and
  cascade through the wrapper. Previously the inner subtree was
  dropped silently.
- Nested `<svg>` viewports now synthesize a rectangle clip-path in
  outer-parent coordinates so descendants outside the authored
  viewport rect are masked at tessellation time (default
  `overflow:hidden` for `<svg>`). Sibling viewports mint distinct
  ids; doubly-nested viewports cascade the innermost clip onto
  descendants. `<clipPath>`, `<linearGradient>`, and `<filter>` defs
  inside a nested `<svg>` reach the global registry. Empty or
  zero-area viewports skip emission. Author `clip-path=` on the
  inner `<svg>` element is overwritten (intersection composition
  not implemented; v1 limitation).
- `gui.PreserveAlignFractions` exported (was `preserveAlignFractions`)
  so `gui/svg` can resolve `preserveAspectRatio` align fractions
  without duplicating the switch.

### Hardened

- SMIL `from`/`to`/`by`/`values` reject malformed tokens (NaN, Inf,
  garbage) instead of coercing to 0. Bogus 0 endpoints would
  previously synthesize real animation timelines; now the timeline
  drops. Color keyframe stops with invalid paint also drop the
  whole color timeline.
- `<use>` `symbolViewportScale` rejects degenerate viewBox
  (`<= 0` width/height) and clamps combined translate (`tx+ax`,
  `ty+ay`) via `boundedScale` so alignment offsets cannot push the
  transform past `±maxCoordinate`.
- Nested-`<svg>` viewport math sanitizes NaN, ±Inf, and oversized
  inputs on `x`/`y`/`width`/`height`, `viewBox`, `parent.W`/`parent.H`,
  and the resulting scale/translate so a poisoned attribute cannot
  propagate non-finite values into the path transform. Percentages
  parse via float64 so `1e30%` no longer truncates to ±Inf before
  scaling.
- `mixOptsHash` clamps `HoveredElementID` / `FocusedElementID` via
  `clampElementID` (256-byte cap) before the FNV mix. Hostile callers
  passing megabyte-sized pseudo-state IDs can no longer burn CPU in
  the cache lookup hash phase; downstream `parseSvgWith` already
  clamped, so cache key and parsed state stay in sync.

### Fixed

- `<text>` now routes through the CSS cascade like shapes, so author
  rules (`text { fill: ... }`), `:hover` / `:focus` matches, and
  `display:none` apply. Previously `<text>` only saw inherited
  computed style with no per-element rule matching.
- Invalid color syntax (e.g. `fill="#GGGGGG"`, `fill="rgb(abc,def,ghi)"`,
  `stroke=""`) is now ignored by the cascade per CSS
  "invalid → ignore", letting inherited paint survive instead of
  clobbering with transparent black. `parseHexColor` rejects
  non-hex digits; `parseRGBColor` rejects non-numeric channels.
- CSS-wide control keywords (`inherit`, `unset`, `revert`,
  `revert-layer`) on `fill` / `stroke` are no-ops so the cascade-
  copied parent paint survives. `<text stroke="inherit">` with no
  ancestor stroke now falls back to a visible default rather than
  being silently dropped.
- `<text>` now inherits `stroke` / `stroke-width` from the cascade,
  and `stroke="inherit"` resolves against the cascade rather than
  forcing black. `<text stroke="none">` clears any ancestor stroke.
- `<tspan>` honors its own `stroke`, `stroke-width`, and `opacity`
  attrs instead of silently copying parent values. `opacity="50%"`
  on `<tspan>` now equals 0.5 (matches CSS keyframe parity below).
- Mixed-content `<text>` runs preserve trailing and interleaved char
  data. `<text>A <tspan>B</tspan> C</text>` now renders all three
  runs; previously the trailing "C" was dropped because only
  pre-first-child `Leading` text was captured. New `xmlNode.Tail`
  field stashes post-child char data so `<use>`-cloned subtrees
  carry it through too.
- CSS `@keyframes { opacity: 50% }` now compiles to 0.5 (was 1.0).
  `compileOpacityTimeline` switched from `parseFloatTrimmed` to
  `parseOpacityNumber` so the static cascade and animated values
  agree on percentage notation.
- `Parser.InvalidateSvgSource` now correctly drops file-backed cache
  entries and every option-variant (FlatnessTolerance,
  HoveredElementID, FocusedElementID, PrefersReducedMotion). Prior
  impl reconstructed hashes from the path string alone, which never
  matched file entries (whose key mixes file contents) and only
  covered two of the option permutations. Walks the entry table by a
  stored `sourceKey` instead.
- `<use>` cloned subtrees no longer leak duplicate descendant ids.
  `stripID` is now recursive; previously only the clone root and (for
  `<symbol>` targets) its top-level children had their ids removed,
  so any nested id collided with the original and corrupted
  `url(#id)` resolution, CSS `#id` matching, and animation targeting.
- `<use width=W height=H>` of a `<symbol viewBox=...>` now scales the
  symbol's viewport to fill the requested box via a composed
  `translate · scale · translate(-vbX,-vbY)` transform. Width/height
  were previously dropped, so callers could not size symbol reuses.

### Security

- `<use x="…" y="…">` author values are parsed numerically instead of
  spliced into the synthesized transform attribute, closing an
  injection vector (`x="0)scale(99)"` previously emitted an extra
  `scale` into the transform list). Also rejects percentage `x`/`y`
  rather than treating "50%" as raw 50, and clamps `<use>`-vs-
  -viewBox scale to ±maxCoordinate to prevent pathological tiny
  viewBox dims from emitting absurd scale factors.
- `stroke-width` on `<text>` and `<tspan>` clamps NaN and negative
  values to 0 via new `sanitizeStrokeWidth`. Negative widths are
  invalid per SVG spec; NaN propagation broke tessellation
  (uint8/uint16 casts implementation-defined, Inf coords break
  bbox math).
- `writeAttrEscaped` (used to reconstruct each element's `OpenTag`
  for substring-scanning helpers like `findAttr` /
  `findStyleProperty`) now also escapes `'` (`&#39;`) and `>`
  (`&gt;`). A hostile attribute value containing a single quote
  could previously smuggle a fake attribute past the cascade
  (`<rect note=" x='99' " x="1"/>` parsed as `x=99`). Both quote
  styles plus `<`/`>`/`&` are now escaped so no value can terminate
  the embedded attr or open a markup token.
- `parseSvg(string)` and `parseSvgDimensions(string)` now enforce
  the existing 4 MB `maxSvgFileSize` cap. The cap was previously
  applied only to file-loaded content; callers passing arbitrarily
  large in-memory strings (e.g. network-fetched SVGs) bypassed it,
  letting unbounded `xml.CharData` accumulation and full-document
  scans run on hostile input. `parseSvg` returns an error;
  `parseSvgDimensions` truncates to the cap before probing.
- `clipPath` triangulation is now cached per `ClipPathID` for the
  duration of one `tessellatePaths` call. N paths sharing one
  complex `clipPath` previously triggered N full re-tessellations
  (`O(N · clipComplexity)` CPU DoS); the cache reduces this to one
  tessellation per unique id. Cache is `nil` when the graphic
  declares no `clipPath`s, so the common icon/spinner path takes
  no extra allocation.

## [v0.15.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- `<use href="#id">` (and `xlink:href`) resolution. The referenced
  subtree is cloned at parse time, wrapped in a synthesized `<g>`
  carrying a `translate(x,y)` transform plus the `<use>`
  presentation attrs (`fill`, `style`, `class`, ...). Cycles are
  guarded by a visited-set + depth-8 cap; the clone has its `id`
  stripped to avoid duplicate ids in the post-expansion tree.
- `<symbol>` is now honored as a `<use>` target — the symbol's
  children are inlined directly (the wrapper is dropped). Untargeted
  `<symbol>` elements continue to render no output. Symbol-level
  `viewBox` / `preserveAspectRatio` honoring is a future polish.
- `spreadMethod` on `<linearGradient>` and `<radialGradient>`:
  `pad` (default), `reflect` (triangle wave), `repeat` (sawtooth).
  `gui.SvgGradientDef.SpreadMethod` is the new field; the previous
  silent-pad behavior is the zero-value default so existing
  fingerprints stay stable.
- `gui.SvgCfg.FlatnessTolerance float32` — tessellation tolerance
  floor in viewBox units. Default 0 keeps the historic 0.15 floor.
  Plumbed via a new `SvgParseOpts.FlatnessTolerance` field and a
  `Window.LoadSvgWithOpts` method; the cache key tracks tolerance
  per quantized 1e-4 step.
- `gui.SvgCfg.HoveredElementID` / `FocusedElementID string` — drive
  CSS `:hover` / `:focus` matching for the SVG element with that id.
  Plumbed through `SvgParseOpts` into the cascade `MatchState`;
  cache invalidates per id transition.
- `examples/svg_use_symbol`, `examples/svg_gradient_spread`,
  `examples/svg_flatness`, `examples/svg_css_states`.

### Changed

- `gui.SvgGradientDef` gains a `SpreadMethod SvgGradientSpread`
  field. Keyed struct literals are unaffected; positional users in
  sibling repos must update.
- `gui.SvgParseOpts` gains `FlatnessTolerance float32`,
  `HoveredElementID string`, `FocusedElementID string`. Additive.
- `gui/svg.ParseOptions` mirrors the same additions.
- `gui/svg.VectorGraphic` gains `FlatnessTolerance float32`. Internal.
- `Window.LoadSvgWithOpts(src, w, h, opts SvgParseOpts)` is the new
  per-render-override entry point. `Window.LoadSvg` is unchanged.

### Deferred to v0.16.0

- Automatic mouse-driven hover detection on the `Svg` widget.
  v0.15.0 ships the parser/cascade/cache plumbing so apps can
  drive `HoveredElementID` themselves (e.g. by hit-testing
  `TessellatedPath.ContainsPoint`); built-in pointer tracking with
  internal hit-test on the widget will land in v0.16.0.
- `<symbol>` `viewBox` / `preserveAspectRatio` honoring.
- `spreadMethod`-aware stop-boundary subdivision (currently
  pad-clamped, so reflect/repeat AA at wrap points is slightly
  softer than at first/last stop).

## [v0.14.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- CSS sibling combinators: adjacent (`+`) and general sibling (`~`).
  Match engine (`gui/svg/css`) now takes a preceding-siblings slice
  alongside ancestors when resolving complex selectors.
- CSS attribute selectors: `[name]`, `[name=v]`, `[name~=v]`,
  `[name|=v]`, `[name^=v]`, `[name$=v]`, `[name*=v]`. Names are
  case-insensitive; values are case-sensitive (no `i`/`s` flag).
  `ElementInfo.Attrs map[string]string` carries the per-element
  attribute map; svg parser populates it from the raw open tag.
- CSS `:hover`, `:focus`, `:not(inner)` selectors — parser + matcher
  only. `Compound` gained `HoverPseudo`, `FocusPseudo`, `Not`
  fields; `ElementInfo` gained a `MatchState{Hover, Focus bool}`
  block. Build-time state can be set via `ElementInfo.State`;
  runtime mouse-event auto-toggle is deferred to v0.15.0.
- `:not()` is single-compound only — comma-list (`:not(.a, .b)`)
  and nested `:not(:not(...))` are deferred.
- `var(--name, fallback)` resolution. The fallback is itself
  resolved recursively (so `var(--a, var(--b, red))` works);
  recursion bounded at depth 32.
- `calc()` arithmetic: `+ - * /`, parens, units `px` and unitless.
  Mixed-unit operands and divide-by-zero invalidate the declaration
  per spec. Nested `calc()` and `calc()` inside `var()` fallback
  are resolved.
- `examples/svg_css_selectors`, `examples/svg_css_vars` — visual
  demos for the new selector and value-resolution machinery.

### Changed

- `css.Match()` and `css.ComplexSelector.Matches()` gained a
  `siblings []ElementInfo` parameter. The sole external caller in
  `gui/svg/style.go` is updated; sibling repos (go-glyph,
  go-charts, go-edit, go-kite) do not call into `gui/svg/css`
  directly. Internal test sites pass `nil` for the new param.
- `Compound`, `ElementInfo`, `MatchedDecl` gained additive fields.
  Keyed struct literals are unaffected.
- `gui/svg.makeElementInfo()` signature gained an `attrs
  map[string]string` parameter (the parsed open-tag attributes).
- The CSS package status table in `docs/svg-support.md` flips
  several rows from "No" to "Yes" (sibling combinators, attribute
  selectors, `:not()`, `var()` fallback, `calc()`).

### Deferred to v0.15.0

- `:hover` / `:focus` runtime mouse-event auto-toggle. The selector
  is recognized today; v0.15.0 will wire the dispatcher (sits at
  the `gui` ↔ `gui/svg` ↔ backend interface boundary, lands cleanly
  alongside `<use>`/`<symbol>` dynamic-cascade work).
- `examples/svg_css_states` — depends on the runtime auto-toggle.

## [v0.13.0] - unreleased

### Added

- SVG accessibility metadata. `<title>`, `<desc>`, `aria-label`,
  `aria-roledescription`, and `aria-hidden` on the root `<svg>` are
  now parsed and exposed via `SvgParsed.A11y` (new `SvgA11y` nested
  struct). Previously dropped silently.
- `<radialGradient>` is now parsed and rendered. Supports
  `cx`/`cy`/`r`/`fx`/`fy` in `objectBoundingBox` (default) or
  `userSpaceOnUse`. Stops use the same semantics as linear
  gradients. Focal interpolation uses a simplified
  distance-from-focal model; full SVG cone-focused projection is
  noted as future polish in `docs/svg-support.md`.
- `preserveAspectRatio` is now honored on the root `<svg>`. All 9
  alignment values (`xMin`/`Mid`/`Max` × `YMin`/`Mid`/`Max`) plus
  `meet`/`slice` are supported. The default (`xMidYMid meet`) is
  unchanged from prior behavior, so existing SVGs render
  identically. `none` (non-uniform stretch) currently falls back to
  default — adding non-uniform render support is tracked as polish.
- `(*TessellatedPath).ContainsPoint(px, py)` for hit-testing filled
  SVG paths. `TessellatedPath` now carries a precomputed bbox
  (`MinX`/`MinY`/`MaxX`/`MaxY`) for fast reject. Author base
  transforms are inverted before the barycentric triangle test.
  Stroke contributions are skipped — pass the fill `TessellatedPath`
  for hit-testing.
- `examples/svg_a11y`, `examples/svg_radial`, `examples/svg_aspect`,
  `examples/svg_hittest` — visual demos for each new feature.

### Changed

- `SvgParsed`, `TessellatedPath`, and `CachedSvg` gained additive
  fields. Keyed struct literals are unaffected; positional literals
  would need to be updated (none found in tree or sibling repos —
  go-glyph, go-charts, go-edit, go-kite).

## [v0.12.7] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- SVG fingerprint goldens (`TestPhase0SmilSpinnerFingerprint`,
  `TestPhaseGCssSpinnerFingerprint`) failed on Linux/WASM CI because
  amd64 ships an asm `math.Sin`/`math.Cos` while arm64 uses pure-Go
  — ULP-level drift in trig output flipped digest bits versus the
  darwin-generated goldens. `hashTessellated` / `hashAnimations` now
  quantize finite floats to a 1e-3 grid before `Float32bits`, so the
  fingerprints stay platform-stable while still catching real
  geometry regressions. Goldens regenerated.

## [v0.12.6] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `SvgSpinner` widget for animated SVG loaders. Full SMIL pipeline:
  `animate`, `animateTransform` (rotate/translate/scale), `animateMotion`,
  per-shape animation keying, attribute overrides, spline easing,
  syncbase `begin` timing, dash animations, TRS-sandwich transforms,
  and per-role opacity. CSS pipeline added: cascade, `@keyframes`,
  `@media`, animation shorthand. Ships with 39 spinner assets across
  the SMIL and CSS sets. See `examples/showcase` for the live gallery.
- `TessellateAnimated` plus parse benchmarks for the SVG path/anim
  pipeline.
- Standalone XML tree parser with per-path animation routing.

### Changed

- SVG parser correctness and performance improvements: scanline
  fill-rule, `Z`-then-`M` path parse fix, dead `GroupID` stripped from
  `TessellatedPath`/`CachedSvgPath`, deduped float helpers, hardened
  animation pipeline.
- Ear-clip tessellator capped at 2048 verts to keep CI under timeout.
- README rewritten: accurate why-go-gui section, spinners video,
  formatting fixes, immediate-mode framing toned down.

## [v0.12.5] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- `Animation.Update` now takes `*AnimationCommands` instead of
  `*[]queuedCommand`. `queuedCommand` was always unexported, which
  made the `Animation` interface effectively impossible for third-
  party packages to implement — they could not name the parameter
  type. `AnimationCommands` wraps the deferred command queue behind
  two public methods:
  - `AppendOnDone(fn func(*Window))` — queues a terminal callback.
  - `AppendOnValue(fn func(float32, *Window), v float32)` — queues
    a per-frame interpolated-value callback.
  All existing first-party animations (`Animate`, `SpringAnimation`,
  `TweenAnimation`, `KeyframeAnimation`, `LayoutTransition`,
  `HeroTransition`, `BlinkCursorAnimation`) updated; callers of the
  stable concrete factories (`NewSpringAnimation`, etc.) see no
  change. Breaking only for downstream code that implemented
  `Animation` directly — impossible to do before this release, so
  no real-world migration.

## [v0.12.4] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Per-call image fetcher on `DrawContext`. New
  `DrawContext.ImageWithFetcher(..., fetcher ImageFetcher)` and
  matching `DrawCanvasImageEntry.Fetcher` field let each image draw
  override `WindowCfg.ImageFetcher` for its own download. Typical
  use: a map widget pairs each tile layer with its source-specific
  User-Agent (OSM-policy UA for one layer, a WMS-provider UA for
  another) without a shared composite fetcher. Existing
  `DrawContext.Image` is unchanged and still routes through the
  window-level fetcher.
- New exported `ImageFetcher` function type and
  `ResolveImageSrcWithFetcher(w, src, fetcher)` helper. Existing
  `ResolveImageSrc(w, src)` is a thin wrapper that passes `nil`, so
  no caller needs to migrate.

### Notes

- Scope cut: `ImageCfg` (the Image widget) keeps the single-fetcher
  path. Per-widget fetcher override will land when a consumer
  demands it; no speculative API.
- Known limit: downloads are URL-keyed process-wide, so the first
  entry observed for a URL binds the fetcher for that URL's in-
  flight download. Consumers wiring two fetchers to overlapping URL
  namespaces must route by URL prefix themselves.

## [v0.12.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- `renderDrawCanvas` now emits images before triangle batches and
  text, so `DrawCanvas` consumers that compose tile backgrounds with
  `DrawContext` overlays get the correct z-order. Previously images
  painted on top of every batch/text in the same canvas — invisible
  in unit tests that only inspect `Texts()`/`Batches()` but user-
  visible once a tile-map demo ran in a window

### Changed

- SDL2 / GL / Metal backends now forward high-resolution
  `MouseWheelEvent.PreciseX` / `PreciseY` for smooth-scroll devices
  (trackpad pixel-scroll, Magic Mouse, high-res wheels), falling
  back to integer `X`/`Y` when the precise field is zero or the SDL
  runtime predates 2.0.18. Enables sub-integer scroll deltas in
  consumers that accumulate fractional `ScrollY`

## [v0.12.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Image download pipeline now handles remote URLs for
  `DrawContext.Image`. Shared `ResolveImageSrc(w, src)` resolves
  http/https URLs to local cache paths, schedules background
  downloads when uncached, and returns "" while in flight.
  `gui.Image` and `emitDrawCanvasImages` both route through it so
  DrawCanvas tiles render after the first fetch
- `WindowCfg.ImageFetcher` hook: apps can supply a custom HTTP
  client to set User-Agent, auth headers, or route through a
  shared pool. Default fetcher sends `User-Agent: go-gui/vX.Y.Z`
  so providers (e.g. OSM) can identify traffic
- `WindowCfg.MaxImageDownloads`: process-wide cap on concurrent
  image downloads. Defaults to 6; first-window-wins for sizing
- Exported `Version` const tracks the module tag

### Fixed

- HTTP status codes are now checked before the body is written to
  disk. Non-200 responses (4xx/5xx) no longer poison the cache
  with error-page payloads

### Changed

- `downloadImage` dropped the HEAD pre-flight and validates
  size/content-type on the GET response. Single round trip per
  fetch

### Performance

- `ResolveImageSrc` caches the URL→path mapping per window so
  already-resolved tiles skip the `MkdirAll` + `Stat` syscalls
  each frame. Critical for DrawCanvas-based tile maps that render
  dozens of images per frame at 60fps

## [v0.12.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- DrawCanvas: `DrawContext.Image(x, y, w, h, src, bgOpacity, bgColor)`
  draws images inside the canvas via the same deferred-emit pipeline
  as text. `src` accepts the same forms as `ImageCfg.Src` (local path,
  http/https URL, data URL)
- DrawCanvas: `DrawCanvasCfg.IDFocus` and `OnKeyDown` enable keyboard
  focus and key event handling. A11Y role flips to button when the
  canvas is focusable

## [v0.12.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- Time-travel debugging: opt-in via WindowCfg.DebugTimeTravel. User state
  implements Snapshotter (Snapshot/Restore; optional Size). Framework
  captures a snapshot after every dispatched event; scrubber window
  auto-spawns alongside the app window with a slider, step buttons
  (first/prev/next/last), cause label, counter, freeze toggle, and
  keyboard shortcuts (arrows, home/end, space, esc)
- Window.Now() virtual clock: returns pinned snapshot timestamp during
  scrub, live time otherwise; use in view fns that render clock-driven
  data so scrubbed frames match their snapshot
- Window.EnableHistory(maxBytes), HistoryLen(), OpenDebugWindow(),
  Freeze/Resume/IsFrozen, PostRestore(idx) public API
- RegisterNamespaceSnapshot(ns): widget authors opt additional StateMap
  namespaces into scrub restore; scroll (nsScrollX/nsScrollY) and
  widget-local focus (nsInputFocus, nsListBoxFocus, nsTreeFocus) are
  pre-registered
- BoundedMap.cloneAny/restoreAny: type-preserving snapshot through an
  interface so whitelisted namespaces rewind without reflection
- examples/time_travel: counter demo wiring Snapshotter + DebugTimeTravel

### Hardening

- Snapshotter.Size() capped at 1 GiB to prevent totalBytes overflow
- Slider NaN/Inf rejected before int conversion in the scrubber
- BoundedMap restore recovers from type-assertion panics so a single
  out-of-sync namespace doesn't break the rest of the scrub
- Parent-window title truncated before composing the scrubber title

### Notes

- Read-only scrub only: rewinding state does not un-do past side effects
  (HTTP requests, file writes, sounds)
- Requires multi-window mode (App + App.OpenWindow). Single-window apps
  log a notice and no-op
- Zero-cost when disabled: nil-history check short-circuits the hot
  path with no allocation

## [v0.11.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- WindowCfg.OnCloseRequest hook: intercept OS window-close and app-quit
  events for save/discard/cancel prompts. Callback owns calling
  Window.Close() to proceed or doing nothing to cancel. Dispatch
  extracted into DispatchCloseRequest / DispatchQuitRequest helpers
  shared by sdl2/gl/metal backends.

## [v0.10.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- DockNode/SplitterState JSON serialization: struct tags, text-marshaled
  enums (DockNodeKind, DockSplitDir, SplitterOrientation, SplitterCollapsed),
  DockNodeSanitize for post-unmarshal hardening
- Showcase docs: new dock_layout component entry, splitter serialization section

### Changed

- SplitterStateNormalize handles NaN/Inf ratios and invalid Collapsed values
- Modernize: sync.OnceFunc/OnceValue, slices.SortStableFunc, cmp.Compare

## [v0.9.9] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Metal backend: native Cocoa file-drop bridge bypasses go-sdl2 crash
  (SDL_free on Cocoa-allocated string); per-window callback map for
  multi-window support

## [v0.9.8] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- File-drop event support: OnFileDrop callback on Container, DrawCanvas,
  and EventHandlers; SDL2 backend maps DropEvent to EventFileDropped

### Changed

- Rename EventFilesDropped → EventFileDropped (singular)

## [v0.9.7] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Bump go-glyph dependency from v1.6.4 to v1.6.5

## [v0.9.6] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- Deduplicate helpers across gui/ (asciiLower, f64Clamp, FNV-1a hash,
  skipLayoutChild, shapeBounds, emitClipCmd, cpInputColumn,
  progressBarCenterLabel, finishDiagramFetch, baseCfg)
- Replace `fmt.Sprintf` with `strconv` in hot paths (data grid, inspector,
  a11y, data source)
- Eliminate per-frame heap allocations: gesture Event scratch pool, defer
  removal in render/image opacity, rotateCoordsInverse float path,
  stack-array cellContent, inspector cache map reuse
- Convert copy-paste spinner tests to table-driven
- Remove redundant state and unnecessary comments
- 42 files changed, −278 net lines

## [v0.9.5] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- `Window.FrameCount() uint64` accessor for the monotonic frame
  counter; lets widgets detect repeat callbacks within a render cycle

## [v0.9.4] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- `Window.SetTitle(string)` + `Window.SetTitleFn(func(string))` — dynamic
  OS window title updates. Wired in sdl2, metal, and gl backends via
  `sdl.Window.SetTitle`
- Input hardening on `SetTitle`: 4 KiB cap, UTF-8-safe truncation,
  embedded-NUL stripping; no-alloc fast path for clean short inputs

## [v0.9.3] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- `NativeSaveDiscardDialog` — Save / Don't Save / Cancel alert for
  unsaved-changes flows
- Native menubar: route macOS app-menu "About" through `OnAction`

### Changed

- License: PolyForm NC 1.0 → MIT

### Fixed

- Solitaire example: replace double-click auto-move with right-click
- CI: brew upgrade harfbuzz/pango text stack on macOS; checkout
  go-glyph for test job and use local replace directive

## [v0.9.2] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- `Window.TextMeasurer()` accessor for downstream widgets that need
  direct access to the backend measurer

### Fixed

- Drop `t.Parallel` on tests mutating `guiTheme.ScrollMultiplier`
  (race-avoidance)

## [v0.9.1] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- Bump `github.com/mike-ward/go-glyph` to v1.6.4
- Bump `golang.org/x/sys` to v0.43.0

## [v0.9.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- `gui/highlight` subpackage: chroma-backed syntax highlighter with curated lexer set (go, python, js/ts, rust, c/cpp, java, ruby, shell, html, css, json, yaml, toml, sql, markdown, diff, dockerfile, make) and DoS caps (256KB source, 100k tokens)
- `MarkdownStyle.CodeHighlighter` field: optional highlighter for fenced code blocks; nil preserves parser's built-in tokenizer
- `MarkdownStyle.CodeTypeColor`, `CodeFunctionColor`, `CodeBuiltinColor` palette fields
- Showcase: component docs, welcome, data grid features, markdown demo, and inspector overlay all use `highlight.Default()`

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- `Spinner` widget: animated mathematical curve loading indicator with 21 named `CurveType` constants (rose, lissajous, hypotrochoid, butterfly, cardioid, lemniscate, epitrochoid, heart wave, spiral, fourier and variants)
- Spinner particle-trail rendering via `DrawCanvas` with faint ghost path outline
- Spinner optional slow rotation (`Rotate` field, 30s per revolution)
- Spinner `Opt[float32]` params (ParamA/B/D) for custom curve tuning
- DrawContext: `QuadBezier`, `CubicBezier` drawing primitives
- DrawCanvas: `OnMouseUp` event
- `ClearNamespace` and `ClearDrawCanvasCache` for targeted cache flush
- Mouse button state in motion events; `OnMouseMove` on `DrawCanvas`
- `OnMouseLeave` event and `RequestRedraw()` for tooltip support
- Showcase: Spinner demo with all 21 curves, varied colors, and rotation examples

### Fixed

- Table column auto-sizing; DrawRecorder `Text()` fall-through
- Live resize redraw on Windows (SDL event watcher)
- Mutex safety: defer Unlock, add missing lock in `ClearViewState`
- gofmt alignment in theme_defaults const blocks

### Changed

- Bump go-gl/gl to 2025-03-31 snapshot
- Bump go-glyph v1.6.1 → v1.6.2
- Set default font to Segoe UI on Windows

## [v0.7.0] - 2026-04-02

### Breaking

- `GridPaginationCursor`/`GridPaginationOffset` iota values shifted; new `GridPaginationNone` (0) added
- `Color.Over` returns `ColorTransparent` (set=true) instead of zero `Color` when both inputs are fully transparent
- `executeFocusCallback`/`executeMouseCallback` removed unused debug string parameter

### Fixed

- Race: synchronize `guiTheme` and `Default*Style` globals with `sync.RWMutex`
- Race: `App.Broadcast` no longer holds lock during user callback (deadlock)
- Race: metal a11y buffers protected with mutex
- Race: SDL2 resize event watcher allocates per-callback instead of sharing pointer
- Bug: layout overflow hides visible children when Float/OverDraw interleaved
- Bug: Fill distribution subtracts OverDraw widths never added to parent
- Bug: stencil depth decrement without matching increment at depth 255
- Bug: masked input edits skip undo/redo stack
- Bug: `InputDate.OnSelect` passes nil `*Event` to callback
- Bug: `queueOnValue` missing nil function guard
- Bug: `ColorFromHSVA` produces wrong colors for negative hue
- Bug: data grid OnHover closure captures stale window pointer
- Correctness: `renderImage`/`renderShape` use defer for shape color restore
- Correctness: SVG render checks `rectIntersection` ok before drawing
- Correctness: `render_validate` checks NaN/Inf/nil for gradient, shadow, blur, shader, rotate
- Correctness: `WithColors` borderFocus falls back to theme-level `ColorSelect`
- Correctness: `WithColors` updates SkeletonStyle and InspectorStyle
- Correctness: `AdjustFontSize` clamps each sub-size individually
- Correctness: `SetTheme` syncs `DefaultInspectorStyle`
- Correctness: `ColorFilterCompose` nil-checks inputs
- Correctness: scroll handlers set `IsHandled` and use shape-relative coords
- Correctness: gesture emits rotate `Began` before first `Changed`
- Correctness: `InMemoryDataSource.Capabilities` acquires read lock
- Correctness: `effectivePaginationKind` returns `GridPaginationNone` when unsupported
- Correctness: dock tree nil Root guard
- Correctness: `bounded_map` eviction handles tombstone-only runs
- Fix: variable shadowing in gesture, data_source, data_source_orm, locale_bundle, view_listbox
- Fix: date-dependent nil panic in TestDatePickerSubElementClickFocus
- Fix: wrap bench missing pool reset; raise CI alert threshold to 200%

### Added

- `GridPaginationNone` constant for unsupported pagination
- `WithInspectorStyle` theme builder
- `StrSourceChanged` locale field
- Data grid CRUD source-change detection and toolbar indicator

### Changed

- Replace `intMin`/`intMax` with Go builtin `min`/`max` (33 call sites)
- Replace `fmt.Sprintf` with `strconv` in per-frame data grid/source paths
- `f32IsFinite` uses bit-pattern check instead of float64 round-trip
- `ColorFilter` factories return pointers to package-level singletons
- `Shortcut.String()` pre-allocates buffer
- `contentWidth`/`contentHeight` skip Float and ShapeNone children, matching `spacing()`
- Move test-only helpers from production files to `_test.go` files
- `native_print` uses defer for lock/unlock
- Document animation spring divergence threshold and zero-delay repeat behavior

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- DrawContext: `Text`, `TextWidth`, `FontHeight` for canvas text rendering
- DrawContext: `FilledRoundedRect`, `RoundedRect` for rounded-corner rectangles
- DrawContext: `DashedLine`, `DashedPolyline` for dashed stroke patterns
- DrawContext: `PolylineJoined` for polylines with miter joins at vertices
- DrawContext: `Texts()`, `Batches()` accessors for testing canvas output
- Render pipeline emits `RenderText` commands from `DrawCanvas`
- Showcase: updated draw canvas demo with line chart (joined polyline, dashed grid, text labels) and bar chart (rounded bars, dashed reference line)
